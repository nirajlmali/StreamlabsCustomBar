# StreamlabsCustomBar

Code for a custom Follower goal bar for my friend who uses Streamlabs. Feel free to use but give proper credit.

## Guide

This works with the following widgets:

* Follower Goal
* Donation Goal
* Sub Goal

No testing done with anything else, but most likely usable with any of the goals with progress bars.

In order to apply it, simply open the widget in Streamlabs, go to `Settings`, check `Enabled` for Custom HTML/CSS, then copy the contents of each file into the respective section:
* `index.html -> HTML section`
* `index.css -> CSS section`
* `scripts.js -> JS section`

Feel free to use this code.
